Wordle but make it sudoku.

Can generate completed puzzles, still need to implement:
- [ ] Generating unsolved (but uniquely solveable) puzzles.
- [ ] Difficulty system.
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Scoring.
- [ ] A betting difficulty system.

Note on removing values: Amount removed seems kinda random, only ever actually achieved removing 10 values once. Must be some edge
where it tries to remove the same value multiple times.
